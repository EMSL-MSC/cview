The .cview files in this directory are PNNL cviews.  In order for them to work, you
will need to be on the PNNL network.  If you look inside those files, you will
notice that they reference an internal PNNL URL (chumbucket.emsl.pnl.gov) that is
only accessible on the internal network.  If you have VPN client that can connect
to the PNNL network, then they should work.  To get the VPN client go to:
vpn.pnl.gov
