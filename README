This source tree has been created to highlight a bug which I have submitted to
the gnustep bugzilla.  Here's the bug description:


This bug only manifests itself on a GNUstep MinGW windows installation.
I am testing on a Windows 7 system, and I installed GNUstep MSYS System,
GNUstep Core, and GNUstep Devel from http://www.gnustep.org/experience/Windows.html.

Here's the problem:

NSClassFromString(@"RandomClass") returns nil if "RandomClass" resides in
a Dynamically Linked Library (DLL), AND "RandomClass" has not yet been used.
If however I make a call like this:

Class foo = [RandomClass class];

right before I make my NSClassFromString(@"RandomClass") call then I no
longer notice the bug.  I have created a quick example code with a Makefile
that is attached, so just untar the code and try it out to verify this is
not working.
