/** 
This class implements the gl drawing code to show a graph of lines above a lower base plane, with X and Y labels, with a z-axix tower showing the height of the data.  The data is provided by a DataSet class.  The coloring of the lines is provided by a self-created ColorMap class.

The class can display 4 types of Grid: Lines, Surfaces, Ribbons and Points.
