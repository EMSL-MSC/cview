# Simple genders file demonstration for use in CVIEW


# CVIEW takes a genders file in a very specific format for this to work

# Rack definitions must start with "rack-"
# Rack definitions must have attributes width/height/depth

rack-HP width=

myrack1


# node names can be anything you like, as long as they follow genders specs.
# I have found that genders does not like parentheses, or any other special characters really (including dashes)
# underscores seem to work though.
# No spaces either, because spaces are the delimeter between node name and attributes

mynode racktype=H
