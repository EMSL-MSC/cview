# Simple genders file demonstration for use in CVIEW


# CVIEW takes a genders file in a very specific format for this to work

# Racktype definitions must start with "rack-"
# Racktype definitions must have attributes width/height/depth

rack-HP width=10,height=50,depth=10

# Nodetype definitions must start with "node-"
# Nodetype definitions must have attributes width/height/depth

node-REG width=9,height=1,depth=7

# Rack definitinos can be named anything as long as they follow genders naming specs
# Rack definitions must have attributes racktype/face/gridx/gridy/gridz
# racktype should be defined in the racktype definitions, and should have the name XXX
# where XXX is stated in racktype definitions as "rack-XXX"
# face can be N/E/S/W (short for north east south or west)
# North is the direction of the negetive-X axis
# South is the direction of the positive-X axis
# West is the direction of the positive-Z axis
# East is the direction of the negetive-Z axis
myrack1 racktype=HP,face=N,gridx=0,gridy=0,gridz=0
myrack2 racktype=HP,face=W,gridx=13.5,gridy=0,gridz=-20

myrack[3-5] racktype=HP,face=W,gridx=20.5,gridy=0
myrack3 gridz=30
myrack4 gridz=40
myrack5 gridz=50

# node names can be anything you like, as long as they follow genders specs.
# I have found that genders does not like parentheses, or any other special characters really (including dashes)
# underscores seem to work though.
# No spaces either, because spaces are the delimeter between node name and attributes

# Node definitions must have attributes nodetype/rack/vposition
# nodetype should be defined in the nodetype definitions, and should have the name XXX
# where XXX is stated in nodetype definitions as "node-XXX"
# The vertical position is along the Y-axis, with 0 being the very middle of the rack
# thus, bottom of rack = -(1/2)*rackheight and, top of rack = (1/2)*rackheight
mynode nodetype=REG,rack=myrack5,vposition=0
anothernode nodetype=REG,rack=myrack1,vposition=4
